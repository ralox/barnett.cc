            Cohorts was my first major release at Mosaic. This is a vital part of the CFO toolkit and covers a wide range of uses. Digging through real-world financial plans, I identified the common patterns and designed a very simple solution.

              <p>
                Mosaic needed a way to bring parity to the modeling process found in traditional spreadsheets. Actually, we needed it to be better. Cohorts are one of the most cumbersome models to setup and maintain, so making it simple would be a huge selling point for the product. 
                
                As the lead designer for all things Financial Model, that job fell to me.

                I'm not a financial expert so I had no idea what we were talking about. The next step was to reach out to our support staff; these folks ARE experts in the field and they spend every day converting old spreadsheets into functional Mosaic models. I learned a lot, but I also learned that I could get hands-on with real models! So I dug in.

While a heavy UI can rely on many visual tools to present complex and layered data, customer-facing <em>functions</em> don't have the same grace.
