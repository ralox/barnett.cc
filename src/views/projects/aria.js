                At scale, the finance industry is swimming in claims of fraud and each of them must be evaluated. Even rejecting a claim can cost more than the cost to pay it. Quavo already had the necessary resources and experience, so we set out to solve that problem with data.

                The basic elements were already settled. What I needed to do was figure out how to get that in front of the users in a way which was informative and gave our clients confidence in the output.

              <p>
                To do that, I broke the main setup into four steps.

                Configuration is like legos without the fun. Our users needed the ability to create custom groups from a long list of possible factors. These would add up scores towards the likelihood of genuine fraud. This loose template ensured that the structure would always be viable but that each org could approach the math their own way.
              </p>
              <p>
                By nesting our factors, we could also present each unique item and its supporting text in isolation. This isolation limits information overload and makes errors easy to locate and repair.

The work performed in market analysis and sales was superb and overlapped significantly with the primary research a UX professional would perform. This lightened the load in a situation where I was already wearing multiple hats.

                  <em className="good-highlight">Project Managers are worth their weight in gold</em>. At the onset, I was attempting to manage Jira and hand out tasks to a junior dev and a dedicated tester. Being a designer, developer, and PM at the same time meant dropping the ball a lot. My performance suffered due to the lack of that external rudder and I now place a lot of value on quality PMs.

                <li>
                  <em className="good-highlight">Pie charts were a bad idea</em>. The next phase of the project was meant to involve loads of rich reporting tools. I was inspired to look into visualizations and learned that even my simple evaluation screen would benefit from improved graphs.
